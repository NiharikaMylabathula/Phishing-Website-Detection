# Phishing-Website-Detection
The given datatset had 30 features that define whether a website is phishing website or not. The 'Result' column contains whether thge website is Phishing or not with 0 being not phishing and 1 being phishing. All the features have values: -1,0,1, so there was no need of Feature Scaling. This Problem is a Binary classification problem, so I used Logistic Regression which yielded an Accuracy of 97%. To improve the accuracy, I used Randomised Search Algorithm, but it did not help. Next I used a Decision Tree classifier which yielded a 99.8% accuracy and only 1 observation was a False Negative. I experimented with a Neural Network, which yielded a 98% accuracy. So the best performing model for this classification problem is the Decision Tree Classifier with default parameters.
